# Mark this node offline so that jenkins does not assign jobs to it.
# This avoids a race condition created by nodepool:
#   Nodepool receives a notification that a job is finished on a node, and begins to destroy
#   the instance in openstack. Because the node is not marked offline and jenkins is not aware
#   of nodepool, jenkins assigns a job to the node that has been waiting for a node with this
#   label to become available in the short span of time when the single job executor on the
#   nodepool node is not running a job and has not yet been removed from the slave pool by
#   nodepool. The job fails because its slave mysteriously disappears from jenkins. Marking
#   the slave node as offline in a post-build step prevents jenkins from assigning jobs to
#   the node.
#
# Marking the slave offline should be the last post-build step on a job, since nodepool
# also terminates nodes that are marked offline in jenkins. This creates another potential
# race condition where a slave is deleted before later post-build steps can finish, which
# also causes the job to fail.
